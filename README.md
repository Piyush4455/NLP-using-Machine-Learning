A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. This is a twitter data scraped from February of 2015 and are classified into positive, negative, and neutral tweets.


Here I have used 3 different classifiers i.e Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Decison Tree classifier and we got the accuracy's as follows :
Logistic Regression : 78.142 %
Multinomial Naive Bayes : 75.751 %
Decision Tree classifier : 69.672 %

So we have finalized Logostic Regression for this use case...
